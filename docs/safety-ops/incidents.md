# When There's an Incident

## As It's Happening Take Notes

The main goal here is to get something down quickly that will help you remember in an hour or so when you sit down to fill out the form we'll have in place for everyone from Public Safety who was involved in an incident to fill out, each providing their own account.

Pen and Paper work well for many people. Some people are faster using a device. You are allowed to make notes in the Public Safety Slack channel, but DO NOT include PII (e,g., who was involved in the incident) in Slack or another semi-public or public forum or shared document.

### Things to Note
- When and Where
- Who was involved (who told you, who was it about, who showed up to help)
- What (times two):
- Briefly describe the incident
- Briefly describe the resolution
- If you escalated, who did you escalate to and when?

## Afterwards Complete An Incident Report

After your shift is complete, or when the Shift Lead or Public Safety Lead asks you to (possibly prior to your shift), you will need to fill out an incident report. We will have a google form set up for this purpose. In it, we will ask you for the following information, which the notes you took at the time of the incident should help you to complete.

- When did the incident start:
- Where was the incident located:
- Who reported the incident (or did you identify the incident yourself):
- Single sentence description of the incident:
- What happened (time - who - event) during the incident (the details of the incident should go in this long section):
- Single sentence describing the resolution of the incident:
- Was this incident escalated (and why):
- When was it escalated:
- Who was it escalated to:
