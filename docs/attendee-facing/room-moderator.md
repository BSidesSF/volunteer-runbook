Make sure the presenter checks in with you 5-10 minutes before their start time. If they haven’t checked in, flag to radioed con staff, i.e. a Safety Ops member or a Staff member.

Ask the presenter if they want to be introduced based on their bio in Sched or whether they will 
intro themselves. Remind folks to submit or upvote questions via the sli.do event.

Open the safari browser on your phone  and navigate to admin.sli.do. Make sure you are in the correct slido room for the talk. If you are proctoring a panel, please work with the panel moderator on how to use slido.
