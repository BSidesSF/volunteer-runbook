## Coat/Bag Receiver

- Receive the coat and/or bag from participants and attach half of the coat tag to the hanger.
- Hand the second half of the tag to the attendee as a receipt.  Note: **ask attendees to take a picture of the receipt so they don’t lose the number.**
- Arrange coats on racks in numeric order.  Tag racks with top/bottom numbers as appropriate. 
- During checkout, match tickets to items, and return the items to the participants.

## T-Shirt Sales/Pre-Sales

### Pre-Ordered Materials (T-Shirts, etc)

- Scan participant receipt via provided hardware and software to determine what materials they have purchased prior to the event.  Training on the hardware and software will be provided on-site.
    - T-Shirts (be careful about what year and size has been pre-ordered)
    - Other items - verify items and quantities
- Obtain materials from stock (may be by the person doing the scanning or a dedicated stock supply role)
- Verify *exactly* what has been paid for is what is being provided
    - T-Shirts - Year, Size, and Quantity
    - Other Items - Item and Quantity
- Provide t-shirt purchasers with tokens for each t-shirt ordered and picked up, to be used in the charity distribution
- Mark the items as having been picked up in the application.
- If there are discrepancies, work with a supervisor to mitigate them.  We may be short of supplies so not all replacements are possible (ex: previous year t-shirts we may have sold out of all other sizes).

### On-Site T-Shirt Sales

- Credit Card Sales:  Attendees will be able to buy t-shirts using a credit card at Coat Check.  We will be provisioned with a Square reader to perform credit-card transactions. Training will be provided on-site on the hardware and software for the purchases.
- Once the purchase has been made, the process for providing the materials purchases follows from step 2 of “Pre-Ordered Materials”

### T-Shirt Tokens

- There will be Charity Boxes placed outside the Coat Check area which attendees can decide which charity they want their t-shirt cost to go towards.
- For every t-shirt sold, hand the attendee one “T-Shirt Token” that they can put in the Charity Box of their choice.
- Information about the charities can be found on in the printed program.

### Lost & Found

- Coat Check will be the area for misplaced/lost items during the conference.
- We will have a “Lost & Found” box to place items for potential claiming.
