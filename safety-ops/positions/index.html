<h2 id="stationary">Stationary</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will be placed at a door or in a room. You will need to stay at that location until relieved or re-assigned.</li>
<li>If you have a question about the responsibilities of your post, ask your Tanuski (Steve) or whomever you are replacing. Many s stationary posts have unique requirements.</li>
<li>If posted at a door, ensure that the doorway is always clear and that people can enter/exit freely.</li>
<li>If posted at an entry-only door, ensure that only people with badges enter. If someone does not have a badge, direct them to the registration desk.</li>
<li>If posted at an exit-only door, ensure no participants enter through that door. If a participant tries to enter through an exit-only door, inform them it is an exit-only door and direct them to the nearest entry door.</li>
<li>If someone is blocking a door, inform them they are creating a potential fire hazard and kindly ask them to move away. 
Your primary job is to observe and report. Do not leave your post if you see or are informed of an issue developing or in progress. Call your Shift Lead or Public Safety Lead to come to your location and let them handle it.</li>
<li>If a medical issue occurs, do not leave your post. Call your Shift Lead or Public Safety Lead, who will dispatch someone to your location.</li>
<li>Do not leave your post if an unauthorized person gets past your position. Call your Shift Lead or Public Safety Lead to your position, provide a detailed description of the person (e.g., height, weight, gender, approximate age, clothing, hair color/style), and let them find &amp; escort that person out.</li>
<li>If you need to contact Shift Lead, please call them. Do not text. It is too easy to miss a text notification in a busy con.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>You will be placed at a door or in a room. You will need to stay at that location until relieved or re-assigned.</li>
<li>Requires interacting with large numbers of people.</li>
<li>May require standing for long periods of time (accommodations available)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="roamer">Roamer</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will have a path/route/areas you will need to patrol. You will be basically "making the rounds" and making sure things are going well. Try not to form a pattern with your route that people could anticipate; mix it up a little.</li>
<li>Check-in with the stationary positions may require a quick break or a beverage. If they need a more extended break than you have time to give, have that person contact their Shift Lead or Public Safety Lead for someone to relieve them.</li>
<li>If you are relieving a stationary post, ask the person you are relieving what the responsibilities of that post are and if there is anything you should be made aware of (e.g., participants to keep an eye on) </li>
<li>If you see an issue developing or progressing, do not handle it alone. Call your Shift Lead or Public Safety Lead to your location if needed.</li>
<li>Contact your Shift Lead or Public Safety Lead if a medical issue occurs. The Shift Lead will radio for someone to your location. Do not leave the person who needs medical attention. When that person arrives, provide any assistance they may need, especially crowd control.</li>
<li>If you feel someone needs to be escorted out of a room or the event, always call your Shift Lead or Public Safety Lead before taking action.</li>
<li>If you need to contact the Shift Lead, please call them. Do not text them. It is too easy to miss a text notification in a busy con.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accessibility_1">Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires you to be able to deescalate tense situations where you can. If a situation is escalating or you're unsure of how to de-escalate, you can call the Safety Ops Lead to assist.</li>
<li>Requires interacting with large numbers of people.</li>
<li>Requires walking for long periods of time .</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shift-lead">Shift Lead</h2>
<ul>
<li>Manage all the general public safety staff for a given shift.</li>
<li>Check in/out all public safety staff when they arrive/leave.</li>
<li>Ensure that stationary positions and roamers get relieved when their shifts are over.</li>
<li>Make sure stationary positions are filled at all times and they are doing their assigned job.</li>
<li>Make sure roamers are roaming and not congregating/chatting/goofing off etc.</li>
<li>Provide all public safety staff starting their shift with any pertinent information they may need (e.g. special events during the shift, any participants to look out for etc).</li>
<li>Ensure that Stationary Positions &amp; Roamers know their assigned jobs/duties/responsibilities at the start of their shift or when they relieve another public safety staff member.</li>
<li>Call Public Safety staff who fail to show up for their shifts on time (i.e., 20 minutes early)(see public safety staff phone list in the Public Safety room).</li>
<li>Keep track of any volunteers that no-call or no-show for a shift and fail to respond to repeated attempts to contact them. We will not be asking those volunteers back again next year.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accessibility_2">Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires you to be able to deescalate tense situations escalated to you by Roamers</li>
<li>Requires you to keep track and check in on many volunteers and give clear guidance to them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="public-safety-lead">Public Safety Lead</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide all public safety staff starting their shift with any pertinent information they may need (e.g. special events during the shift, any participants to look out for etc).</li>
<li>Make sure Shift Leads have what they need to manage their volunteers</li>
<li>Collect incident reports from Public Safety volunteers after an issue has been handled, making sure that it has been filled out completely.</li>
<li>If a disciplinary issue with a volunteer needs immediate action, take appropriate steps to resolve the issue (including, but not limited to, discussing the issue with the volunteer, re-assigning the volunteer to another post, sending the volunteer 'home' for that shift).</li>
<li>Inform Shift Lead of any volunteer issues as soon as possible. Depending on the issue, an incident report may need to be filed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="accessibility_3">Accessibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires you to be able to deescalate tense situations escalated to you by Shift Leads</li>
<li>Requires you to resolve disciplinary issues with volunteers</li>
